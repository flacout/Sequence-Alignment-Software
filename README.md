# Sequence-Alignment-Software
Is a protein and DNA Global alignment, with a Graphical User Interface, created with python2.7 and Tkinter.

The application allows you to download text file or copy/paste your sequence.
You can also export your result as a text file.

To open the application, run the "align_GUI.py" script.

The global alignment is base on the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm. I recommand using it with sequence < to 600pb, because the algorithm has not been optimized and it would take to much time to process.
